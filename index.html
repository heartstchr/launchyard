                               <p>Andrew and Sarah are husband and wife and co-founders of The Albums. They started it to share pictures with their own families, spread across 8 time zones, in a safe secure environment. 
                               </p>
                               <h1 class="epsilon">How was the The Albums born?</h1>
                               <p>We weren’t looking to start a startup, but once we got the idea in our heads we couldn’t get it out. Four years ago, we moved across the world from Norman, Oklahoma to Beirut, Lebanon. One night we were looking through pictures together of what our friends at home were up to… vacations they had just taken or moments with their babies that were growing so, so fast. 
                               </p>
                               <p>As thankful as we are for all the online tools that make the thousands of miles between Beirut and Oklahoma seem so much smaller, we commented to each other that night that none of them seemed like the best place for the amazing family pictures we were seeing. We talked about how they didn’t feel personal enough or peaceful enough. None of them seemed like a lasting place for a family to gather around ten or fifteen years from now to remember the incredible moments they had shared. So we started dreaming and brainstorming about what kind of place we would want to use one day for our family… 
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                What we wanted was a place built just for families that could capture the feeling of looking through those old photo albums. Not necessarily as a storage site for every single one of the pictures we take, but as a place to keep & remember our favorite moments and to share them with our best friends and our families at home.
                              </p>
                              <h1 class="epsilon">What steps did The Albums take to launch?</h1>
                              <p>We drew up some wireframes and then turned that into a static site to get feedback from our friends and family. We received positive feedback from our initial users but based on constructive criticism on our template, we iterated on our design keeping our core ideas and values. From there, we made a landing page and collected email addresses until a certain threshold that we had set as our target. It was then time to register The Albums and recruit a team. </p> 
                              <h1 class="epsilon">How did they connect with LaunchYard?</h1>
                              <p class="extra-bottom">Andrew interviewed some developers and online entrepreneurs and decided it was best to wait to hire an in-house team until The Albums had sustainable growth. <a href="http://www.rajeshsetty.com/" class="case-hreflink">Rajesh Setty</a> introduced Andrew to the team at LaunchYard.</p> 
                              <h1 class="epsilon feedback-title">Feedback on the first interaction</h1>
                              <p class="feedback-text extra-bottom"><i class="icon-quote-left quote"></i> Atif quickly gained my trust by not making careless promises and making a concrete, straightforward proposal.  <i class="icon-quote-right quote"></i> - <span>Andrew Kopke</span></p> 
                              <h1 class="epsilon">How did LaunchYard help?</h1>
                              <p>Andrew was very clear about the vision he had for his product and built features in a logical progression, getting feedback from live users at every step, before building further. 
                              </p>
                              <p>As our usual process, we focused on defining a release version which we could launch in under two months. The core functionality they needed to launch was:
                              </p>
                              <ul>
                              <li>Simplified responsive User interface</li>
                               <li>User management system</li>
                               <li>Album creation and picture uploads with strict privacy at the code level</li>
                               <li>Albums sharing with friends, family and individuals.</li>
                               </ul>
                             </p>
                             <p>We first focused on identifying a suitable technology stack that could work with these demands and also scale easily later on.
                             </p>
                             <h1 class="dev-text">Front-end development </h1>
                             <p>Since the requirement was to build a web application which should work and look perfect on all various PC, laptop and mobile devices and screens, we needed a flexible framework that supports responsive design which can work on multi-platform and devices smoothly. We had some experience with Zurb <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Foundation</a> and we found it that it works really well for responsive design that is being continuously iterated. We went with this for The Albums, and were really happy with our results.
                             </p>
                             <p>

                            <p>The decision to go with Django and Python was not that tough. Image centric sites like Instagram and Pinterest are built using Django, and our love for Python made it easy to go with <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank" class="case-hreflink">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" class="case-hreflink">Django</a>.</p>

                             <h1 class="epsilon">About the Founder <span class="link"><a href="https://twitter.com/m4g005" target="_blank"><i class="icon-circle-arrow-right"></i></a></span></h1>
                             <p>Rob Henson has 15+ years in media licensing. He is the founder of Evolve Images and president of PACA.</p>
                             <p>Matthew Goos has worked in the software industry for 15+ years. They met while they each worked at Getty Images. Their kids are friends and working together was a natural thing.</p>
                             <h1 class="epsilon">How was the Picquity born?</h1>
                             <p>Picquity was conceived from a services gap within the photo industry -- specifically, they identified the services of enterprise image tracking companies who provid image use reporting to large agencies. These businesses were all enterprise solutions and at a high cost. At the same time, Matthew and Rob knew there was a large need for these solutions at a lower cost across a prosumer-level strata -- that of the professional or amateur photographer. Realizing that no one was addressing this market opportunity, they set out to prove their concept of a low cost, frictionless image discovery service: Picquity was born.</p>
                             <h1 class="epsilon">What steps did Picquity take to launch?</h1>
                             <p>Initially, Matthew and Rob set up a static web site explaining what Picquity was. It opened the door to conversations with others in the space willing to give a little seed money to get an MVP up and running. Matthew, who was a programmer, created a proof of concept web crawler that integrated into image fingerprinter. Things were looking good.</p> 
                             <h1 class="epsilon">How did they connect with LaunchYard?</h1>
                             <p class="extra-bottom">They soon realized Matthew that could not do all of the coding alone. They specifically went looking for an outsourcing team focused on startups, that was affordable and could solve sophisticated challenges. Matthew and Rob spoke with loads of folks before connecting with LaunchYard. Our technical depth, startup values and track record tipped the scales in our favor..</p> 
                             <h1 class="epsilon feedback-title">Feedback on the first interaction</h1>
                             <p class="feedback-text extra-bottom"><i class="icon-quote-left quote"></i> It was very smooth. We shared the vision of what we needed and LaunchYard 
                              team was able to take this information and come backwith some estimates 
                              for work. <i class="icon-quote-right quote"></i> - <span> Matthew Goos, Co-founder</span> </p> 
                              <h1 class="epsilon">How did LaunchYard help?</h1>
                              <p>Rob and Matthew wanted a system which had the minimal necessary functionality for early adopters that can be released quickly with minimal investment so they could validate their ideas before spending more time and money.</p>
                              <p>As a first step, we focused on defining a launch release version which we could launch in under two months. The core functionality was to manage user’s uploaded images, fingerprint them and match them with the massive list of already fingerprinted curated wild images across the web. We also realized that it was important to accept one-off and recurring payments so that we could iterate on our business model early on.</p>
                              <p>Based on the launch release feature set, we identified the key technical challenges:</p>
                              <p> 
                                <ul>
                                  <li>To manage massive image processing intensive actions.</li>
                                  <li>Store and access unstructured data.</li>
                                  <li>Processing massive list of images from different websites.</li>
                                  <li>Handling recurring payments.</li>
                                  <li>Time constraint to launch it early to validate with the early customer.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </p>
                              <p>The first thing needed to figure out the best possible technology stack that can work seamlessly and scale easily. After a couple of brainstorming session, we came up to the conclusion to use non-sql database because of a lot of unstructured data, and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Mongodb</a> instantly became the default database.We also needed a queuing system to process images asynchronously. We had a great experience with <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Celery</a> and we went ahead with it, and <a href="http://redis.io/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Redis</a> as a message broker for Celery.</p>
                              <p>The final technology stack which we have used to build Picquity:</p>
                              <p>
                                <ul>
                                 <li>Programming language - Python</li>
                                 <li>Web framework - Flask</li>
                                 <li>Database - Mongodb</li>
                                 <li>Task queue - Celery</li>
                                 <li>Task queue message broker - Redis</li>
                                 <li>Web server - Nginx</li>

                               </ul>
                               <h1 class="dev-text">Development</h1>
                               <p class="extra-bottom">We divided up the launch release version into weekly release cycles broken down by product features that the founders could track. As every feature was released, Rob and Matt, would test and iterate with us in real-time. We went to work building the system using <a href="http://www.python.org/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Python</a> (one of our favorite programming language) on <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Flask</a> web framework. We ran a couple of task queues to fingerprint the images, image resizing for thumbnails, search sites, and upload images to Amazon S3. We also integrated the <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="blank" class="case-hreflink">Stripe</a> API to accept recurring payments using credit card card.</p>
